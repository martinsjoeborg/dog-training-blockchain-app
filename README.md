<p> We have built a proof-of-concept blockchain web-application that allows users to "buy" and "train" dogs as NFT´s. We have used 3 different APIs for this app: <br> 
</p>
<ul>
<li>https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all : We used this API to fetch a list of possible dogs to buy</li><li>https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random : We used this API to get an image of the dog, both for the blockchain and for the wallet view</li><li>https://namey.muffinlabs.com/name.json : We used this API to get a random name for the dog</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Users first add their login-info and once logged in, they can start "buying" and "training" dogs, as well as seeing their blocks get added to the chain</p>
